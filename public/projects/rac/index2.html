Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Service.

Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link on this Service or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy. 8.2. Third Party Collection Of Your Credit Card Information. If you choose to subscribe to a Purchased Service, our third party credit card processor (Stripe) will process your credit card. Accordingly, you authorize RAD to collect, use, retain and disclose your credit card and other payment information to Stripe and represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to disclose such information to us. In addition, we may share your PII with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Service, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your PII. If you have questions about how Stripe protects the data it receives from RAD Users, please refer to https://stripe.com/us/terms and https://stripe.com/us/privacy. RAD does not receive or store credit card information on our servers. We receive a transaction “token” and a one-time use ID number so we can validate that the transaction has been successfully completed. Areas of this Service that collect your Personally-Identifying Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption; however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection. 8.3.

The security of your information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personally-Identifying Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
